2008-04-29 20:56:02	MrElendig	[2007-12-18 18:53] The way fontconfig is configured has been changed.
2008-04-29 20:56:03	MrElendig	[2007-12-18 18:53] Configuration is done via /etc/fonts/conf.avail and conf.d.
2008-04-29 20:56:03	sykopomp	my first bet would be that something is wrong with your gtkrc/wherever your gtk settings are
2008-04-29 20:56:05	MrElendig	[2007-12-18 18:53] Read /etc/fonts/conf.avail/README for more information.

2008-04-29 21:59:00	MrElendig	linfan: what card/driver

2008-04-29 21:59:36	MrElendig	SickHate: azureus gives you teh best speed tho
2008-04-29 21:59:41	skarface	you could probably spoof the client

2008-04-29 21:59:46	comhack	private trackers are the best
2008-04-29 21:59:50	Hail_Spacecake	it's got to be trivial to spoof the client

2008-04-29 22:00:24	MrElendig	relativly easy for the tracker to find out if you are spoofing the client
2008-04-29 22:00:25	skarface	Hail_Spacecake: because they're lamefucks?
